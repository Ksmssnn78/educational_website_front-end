                <p class="course_des">course descriptions: This course is designed to build the student’s knowledge of web design and development to an intermediate level. Students will learn the fundamental languages and markups for front-end web programming and be introduced conceptually to some of the more complex web topics including Web-to-Print, Responsive Web Design, and Server Technology. By the end of this course, students should be able to design, program and publish a working and atheistic website. Students will also go through the process of working in a client/designer relationship, learning the communication skills necessary to successfully fulfill each role.

                <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                <p class="course_des">course descriptions: This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence. It contains a theory component about the concepts and principles that underlie modern AI algorithms, and a practice component to relate theoretical principles with practical implementation. The course divides into four parts. The first part of the course discusses search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Min-Max trees). The second part of the course discusses probability as a mathematical tool, Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. The third part of the course overviews machine learning algorithms both supervised and unsupervised. An introduction to learning by reinforcement is included as well The last part concerns logic and planning algorithms such as value iteration for MDP. Along the course we highlight application domains such as robotics (e.g. particle filters for perception) and natural language processing. The objective is to give an overall idea about the field without delving into advanced details whenever possible.
